Google just hosted their annual developer conference (I/O). As exciting as new versions of Android are, what's got the Lick Innovation team talking is the upgrade to the Google Cardboard virtual reality headset. We're big fans of Cardboard's cheap VR experience, and the new design only adds to its capabilities.

Google also announced a partnership with GoPro to create a 16-camera rig that can shoot 360 degree video. Dubbed '[Jump](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/jump/)', this rig is specially designed to create 360 video for Cardboard and YouTube's new immersive video player. This should help aspiring VR filmmakers, as until now rigs like these have been slightly awkward custom jobs.

Cardboard now has room for phones with up to 6" screens, which means flagship phones like the Nexus 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will fit. It also drops the old magnet-button in favour of a conductive foam pad on the side. Given that the magnet caused issues with quite a few phones (and was fiddly to keep in place) this is a welcome change. Assembling a Cardboard flatpacked kit is now easier too; it takes three simple steps, compared to about ten minutes of fiddling and watching instructional videos before.

The Cardboard software has also been expanded. Google's own Cardboard app is now available on iOS as well as Android, and a new SDK allows iPhone developers to get stuck into cheap virtual reality too.

These updates follow on from Google's creation of a [certification scheme](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/16/8431303/google-works-with-cardboard-announced-virtual-reality) in April, allowing headset manufacturers to automatically adjust the Cardboard experiences for their specific lenses and dimensions. There were also a set of design guidelines to help developers build VR apps for Cardboard, teaching them how to craft experiences that don't make viewers nauseous.
