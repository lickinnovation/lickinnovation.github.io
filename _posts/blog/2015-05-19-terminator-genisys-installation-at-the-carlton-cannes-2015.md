The 68th Cannes Film Festival got underway last week and, after months of hard work by many at Lick, Terminator Genysis dominated the sea front. We have worked with Paramount for a few years on this activity, but this  campaign was the most varied in terms of different mediums used to help launch the blockbuster.
 
The front of the Carlton was transformed by a huge 5m x 4m HD digital screen. We used the latest 6mm LED technology to ensure the highest fidelity possible, and were showing exclusive content produced for the event (which we can monitor directly from a webcam hidden in the undergrowth).

Passersby could scan QR codes to view the latest trailer on YouTube (hereâ€™s the code if you want to get involved). In addition to the fantastic vinyl artwork on the porch, La Cote Restaurant and entrance floor, hotel guests were greeted by huge Terminator skulls with bespoke motion activated eyes, embedded behind duratrans, that shone down on them as they left the building.
