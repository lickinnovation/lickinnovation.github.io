Traditionally point of sale has lacked the ability to reach out and grab consumers. Beacons change this, allowing us to contact passersby through their smartphones.

###Overview
Beacons are small Bluetooth emitters that detect nearby smartphones, sending them a location-specific code that activates an app on the phone.

###Benefits

Retailers can use beacons to send notifications to shoppers when they are in the vicinity of a store. This notification is more effective than a promotional email because it is so context relevant. They are shopping, in your store, right now. Beacons are the only way to guarantee this specific a reach.

Imagine being able to get a special offer to a customer as they walk into your shop, knowing that *only* those in the shop will see it. Beacons also increase buy in for retailer apps, providing more useful functionality when the customer wants it (in-store) rather than arbitrarily.

###Support

Beacons use low-energy Bluetooth, which is standard on all modern smartphones. Most modern phones also switch Bluetooth on by default, meaning many more customers will be able to receive your messages.

All that is required is an app on the customer's phone to detect the beacon and send the notification. This app needs to be configured with a beacon specific SDK, and can either belong to the beacon owner or be a third party app that is part of a beacon network. The presence of the app on the phone implies customer opt-in to the notifications, however the volume and frequency should be carefully considered to avoid overwhelming someone as they walk down the high street.
