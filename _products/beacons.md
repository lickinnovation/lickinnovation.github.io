###Overview

Beacons are small Bluetooth emitters that connect to smartphones, sending them a location-specific code that activates an app on the phone.

###Benefits

Retailers use beacons to send notifications to shoppers when they are in the vicinity of a store. This notification is more effective than an email because it is so context relevant.

Imagine being able to get a special offer to a customer as they walk into your shop, knowing that *only* those in the shop will see it.

###Support

Beacons use low-energy Bluetooth, which is standard on all modern smartphones. Most modern phones also switch Bluetooth on by default, meaning many more customers will be asks to receive your messages.

All that is required is an app on the customer's phone to detect the beacon and send the notification. This app needs to be configured with a beacon specific SDK, and can either belong to the beacon owner or be a third party app that is part of a beacon network.
