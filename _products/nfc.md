##Overview

Near-field communication (NFC) is the technology use in Oyster cards and contactless payments.

##Benefits

In a retail context it allows customers to tap their smartphone on POS to receive special offers or view online experiences.

NFC tags are cheap and easy to integrate into POS, so as long as you have digital content you want to drive customers too there are no barriers to implementation.

##Support

Currently they are supported by nearly all Android and Windows phones, but not iPhones. The iPhone 6 does have NFC but is currently limited to the Apple Pay system. We foresee this technology being opened up in the near future however
