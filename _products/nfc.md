NFC tags allow us to leverage the supercomputers we all carry in our pockets to provide information and experiences to consumers.

##Overview

Near-field communication is the technology used in Oyster cards and contactless payment cards. It allows small amounts of information to transfer between the NFC chip and the device reading it. For our purposes this information is nearly always a web URL - this can instantly take consumers to information they may need or engaging online experiences.

##Benefits

In a retail context it allows customers to tap their smartphone on POS to receive special offers or view online experiences.

NFC tags are cheap and easy to integrate into POS, so as long as you have digital content to drive customers to there are no real barriers to implementation. They don't require any infrastructure investment as we rely on customers carrying their own screens.

##Requirements

Currently NFC is supported by nearly all Android and Windows phones, but not iPhones. The iPhone 6 is NFC-capable but is currently limited to the proprietary Apple Pay system. We foresee this technology being opened up in the near future however, which will give NFC near-universal coverage in the smartphone market. For the time being we recommend including a QR code with the same URL as the NFC tag, so iPhone users are still included.
