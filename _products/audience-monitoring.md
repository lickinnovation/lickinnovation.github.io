Return on investment for point of sale has always been difficult to measure. This is why we like to install our audience monitoring set up on POS in key locations.

##Overview

It consists of a discreet sensor connected to a mini-PC. The unit analyses passersby, recording:

- number of people in the vicinity
- proportion who look at the POS
- duration they look at the POS for
- some non-personal demographic info:
  - age range
  - gender

##Benefits

This technology gives you incredible feedback for your in-store campaigns - feedback that was previously limited to exit surveys or online media.

You can now quantify the impact your POS or display by directly measuring not only the number of viewers but the potential audience, attention time and demographics of the audience. This can be used to feedback on campaigns or even adjust digital content in real time.

##Requirements

- A sensor enclosed in the POS
- A small PC with power access enclosed in the POS
- The sensor needs to be facing the same direction as the POS
