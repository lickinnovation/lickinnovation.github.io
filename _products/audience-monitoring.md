Return on investment for point of sale has always been difficult to measure. This is why we like to install our audience monitoring set up on POS in key locations.

It consists of a discreet sensor connected to a mini-PC. The unit analyses passersby, recording:

- how many people are in the vicinity
- the proportion that look at the POS
- how long they look at it for
- some non-personal demographic info:
  - age range
  - gender

This technology gives you incredible feedback for your in-store campaigns, feedback that was previously limited to exit surveys or online media.
